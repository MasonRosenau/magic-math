# Magic Math

This application is a game based on math, equations, and in some cases, quite a bit of planning!

## Objective
The goal of this game is to <strong>reach the goal</strong> given numbers and operators. You should "reverse engineer" the goal as if a sequence of operations was taken to reach that number.

## Game Flow
First click a number, then an operation, then another number to complete one equation. This is your first equation, and it will appear in the Work Area on the right.

You'll notice the solution to your first operation will replace one of your available numbers on the left and one will disappear. This means you only have <strong>three attempts</strong> to reach the goal.

To win, the solution to one of your operations must equal the goal. In other words, you the goal must appear on a button as a result of your operation.
